Exercise 2
In exploit-2a I overflow the return address reqpath in zookd.c, 
in exploit-2b I overflow the envvar[512] in http.c to save the file name 
"/home/httpd/grades.txt"

Exercise 3
I use the reqpath here to overflow. url and regexp can also be used
as regexp is also inited by url and url can be overflowed from user request. 
Value and envvar can be used as value can be overwritten by header from user
request and envvar can be overwritten by value.

Exercise 4
I use reqpath in exploit-4a and envvar in exploit-4b, url and 
regexp can be also used as in fact they contain the same value with reqpath, 
value can be used before it transfers its value to envvar.

Exercise 5
a.The profile from user may contain some malicious code affects the other users.
b.There is no auth when transfering zoobars between users, so an attacker may
call the transfer service to change the other users' information or others.
